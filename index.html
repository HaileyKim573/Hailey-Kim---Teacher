        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Hailey Kim and I am a first year student at UCR. I just recently turned 19 years old and I have an older brother who is 21. I live in a household of 4 which consists of my mom, dad, brother, and myself. I also have a small yorkie named Charlie. I grew up in Southern California in the Orange County area. I had a great childhood along with a great education in the area that I grew up in. From a young age, I knew what I wanted to do in the future. <br><br>

        Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to pursue being a teacher. I was inspired by multiple teachers from elementary school to high school. High school was when I knew I was set on being an elementary school teacher. Throughout high school I took classes that would help me follow my path in becoming a teacher. This included being a teacherâ€™s assistant for a precalculus class, taking a psychology class, and general education classes. Although I had a lot of fun my senior year, I also knew that I had to focus on classes and college applications. I struggled when decisions came out because I was stuck between two schools. My parentâ€™s support throughout the whole process helped me a lot. <br><br>

        After making my final decision, I decided to attend the University of California, Riverside as an Education major. I have now been here for over a month and I can say I definitely made the right decision. Along with the classes here, social life is very important to gain friendships and connections. Week 0 is the best time to engage with other students and RAs. I was able to become friends with a lot of people in my hall, get closer to people I already knew before, and make new friends in my classes. I was easily able to register for my classes and a lot of it revolved around my major and what I could be doing as a future educator. For the month I was here I made friendships with the people around me while enjoying being an education major.
